# run_analysis.R
Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Copy the rur_analysisâ€™s file into R, and there will be 2 tidy Data Sets in files labeled
DataSet1 and DataSet2.  Both files will appear in your working directory.
See the Code Book for details on the variables in the dataset.

The script will create the data sets and remove all variables and scripts created.
A script that is created (and removed) is a script called writeFiles.  It writes the 
tables into DataSet1 and DataSet2.  DataSet1 and DataSet2 are available for download 
in this repository as well.

 
The script also downloads and unzips the UCI HAR Dataset.  This is the raw data that
data sets 1 and 2 are derived from.  The data set can be found at the following URLs
